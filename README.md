# OSU-AIBC-Project-3
## Overview
For our final project, we decided to focus on handwriting recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to build a model that can classify images of handwritten digits, leveraging the MNIST dataset as a starting point.

## Approach
### Data Collection

### Data Pre-processing

### Model Building

### Training

### Evaluation

### Prediction















Model Implementation (25 points)
There is a Jupyter notebook that thoroughly describes the data extraction, cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation process, and the cleaned data is exported as CSV files for a machine or deep learning model, or natural language processing (NLP) application. (10 points)

A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model or loads a pretrained model. (10 points)

At least one additional library or technology NOT covered in class is used. (5 points)

Model Optimization (25 points)
The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV file, Excel table, or in the Python script itself. (15 points)

Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script. (10 points)

GitHub Documentation (25 points)
The GitHub repository is free of unnecessary files and folders and has an appropriate .gitignore in use. (10 points)

The README is customized as a polished presentation of the content of the project. (15 points)

Presentation Requirements (25 points)
Your presentation should cover the following:

An executive summary or overview of the project and project goals. (5 points)

An overview of the data collection, cleanup, and exploration processes. Include a description of how you evaluated the trained model(s) using testing data. (5 points)

The approach that your group took to achieve the project goals. (5 points)

Any additional questions that surfaced, what your group might research next if more time was available, or a plan for future development. (3 points)

The results and conclusions of the application or analysis. (3 points)

Slides that effectively demonstrate the project. (2 points)

Slides that are visually clean and professional. (2 points)
